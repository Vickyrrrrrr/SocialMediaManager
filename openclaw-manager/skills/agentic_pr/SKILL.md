# Skill: AgentIC PR

## Description
This skill automates the promotion of hardware improvements generated by the AgentIC framework. It reads numerical benchmarks (Area, Power, Slack, DRC) and generates engaging social media posts for X (formerly Twitter).

## Configuration
- **Metrics File**: `data/public_metrics/latest.json`
- **Output Script**: `skills/agentic_pr/post_to_x.py`

## Sky130 Industry Baselines (Reference)
- **Area Efficiency**: ~150k-200k gates/mm² for high-density logic.
- **Power**: Competitive power is below 10µW/MHz/gate.
- **Timing**: Positive slack (Slack >= 0ns) at 50-100MHz.
- **DRC**: Exactly 0 violations (Mandatory for tape-out).

## Commercial EDA Correlation (Cadence/Synopsys)
Standard "Commercial Grade" targets for a Counter/Common IP:
- **Area Gap**: Commercial tools typically achieve 10-15% smaller area than default OpenLane.
- **Power Gap**: Commercial tools achieve ~20% better power optimization.
- **Tape-out Readiness Checklist**:
    1. **DRC**: 0 Violations.
    2. **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)**: Passthrough (100% matching).
    3. **Antenna Rules**: 0 violations.
    4. **Density Check**: Must be between 35% - 70%.
    5. **IR Drop**: Within 5% of VDD.


## Behavior & Logic
1. **Trigger**: When `/check_latest` is received via Telegram.
2. **Analysis**:
    - Load `data/public_metrics/latest.json`.
    - **Compare with Industry Standards**:
        - **Area**: Is it significantly better than 150k gates/mm²?
        - **Power**: Is it below 10µW/MHz?
        - **Slack**: Is it positive and stable?
        - **Design Name**: Identify which design (e.g., `counter`, `aes`, etc.) the metrics belong to.
3. **AI Evaluation**:
    - Determine if the design is "World Class" or "Better than Industry Standard".
    - Provide a `RECOMMENDATION`: "Post recommended" or "Further optimization suggested".
4. **Draft Generation**: Generate an exciting X post highlighting the design name and the specific benchmark that beats the standard.
5. **Confirmation**: Wait for `/confirm` from the user before calling `post_to_x.py`.

## Triggers
- **Check**: `/check_latest` (Triggers extraction and AI comparison).
- **Post**: `/confirm` (Publishes the draft to X).


## Execution
The AI will call `post_to_x.py` with the generated text as the final step.
